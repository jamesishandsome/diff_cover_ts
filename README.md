## 🚀 Introduction

`diff_cover_ts` helps you maintain high code quality by focusing on what matters most: **the code you just changed**. Instead of failing builds because of low legacy coverage, this tool ensures that every new commit meets your quality standards.

It works by comparing your current branch with a base branch (e.g., `origin/main`) and reporting coverage/quality gaps only for the modified lines.

## ✨ Features

- **🎯 Precision Coverage**: Report code coverage only for modified lines in your git diff.
- **🛡️ Quality Gate**: Enforce linting checks only on changed code.
- **🤖 Auto-Configuration**: Seamlessly detects `vite.config.ts/js` or `vitest.config.ts/js` to find coverage reports.
- **📊 Multi-Format Support**: Compatible with `lcov`, `cobertura`, `clover`, `jacoco`, and generic XML reports.
- **⚡ Git Integration**: Built-in git history analysis to identify modified lines accurately.
- **🚫 Fail-Under Checks**: Set thresholds to fail CI/CD pipelines if coverage/quality is too low.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Using npm (Global)
npm install -g diff-cover

# Using Bun (Global)
bun add -g diff-cover

# Using npm (Dev Dependency)
npm install diff-cover --save-dev
```

## 🛠 Usage

### Diff Cover

Automatically identify lines in your diff that lack test coverage.

#### ⚡ Auto Configuration (Recommended)

If you are using **Vite** or **Vitest**, simply run:

```bash
diff-cover
```

The tool will intelligently parse your configuration files to locate the coverage report and determine the format.

#### 📝 Manual Usage

You can explicitly specify the coverage report files:

```bash
diff-cover coverage/lcov.info
# OR
diff-cover coverage/cobertura.xml
```

```bash
diff-quality report.txt --violations <driver>
```

#### 🔌 Supported Drivers

- `eslint`
- `pylint`
- `flake8`
- `shellcheck`
- `cppcheck`
- `checkstyle`
- `findbugs`

## 💻 Development

### Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run test suite
bun test

# Run tests with coverage
bun test --coverage
```

### Code Quality

We use `oxlint` for linting and `oxfmt` for formatting. Pre-commit hooks via `husky` ensure code quality.

```bash
# Lint code
bun run lint

# Format code
bun run format
```
